## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js version 16 or higher
- npm package manager version 8 or higher
- A modern web browser that supports ES6 features

### Installation Process

First, clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred method. Navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies by running npm install. This will download and configure all necessary packages including React, React Router, Mock Service Worker, and other essential libraries.

### Development Environment

To start the development server, use npm start which will launch the application on localhost port 3000. The development server includes hot reloading, so changes to your code will automatically refresh the browser. The application uses Mock Service Worker to simulate API calls, so no backend server is required for development.

### Production Build

For production deployment, run npm run build to create an optimized build in the build folder. This process minifies the code, optimizes assets, and prepares the application for deployment to any static hosting service.

### Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite that can be executed using npm test. This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode, allowing you to see test results in real-time as you make changes to the codebase.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture

The application follows a modern React architecture using functional components and hooks throughout. The component structure is organized around feature-based modules, with each major functionality contained within its own page component. State management is handled locally within components using React hooks, avoiding the complexity of external state management libraries.

### Data Flow Pattern

Data flows through the application using a unidirectional pattern. Components receive data through props and communicate changes through callback functions. The application maintains a clear separation between presentation components and business logic, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

### Routing System

Navigation is handled by React Router, providing a single-page application experience with client-side routing. The routing system supports nested routes, dynamic parameters, and programmatic navigation, enabling complex user flows while maintaining clean URLs.

### Styling Approach

The application uses pure CSS without external frameworks, providing complete control over the visual design. The styling system includes CSS custom properties for theming, comprehensive responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach, and a comprehensive color system that supports both light and dark modes. Mobile responsive features include hamburger menu navigation, touch-optimized interfaces, and adaptive layouts for all screen sizes.

### API Layer Design

The API layer is implemented using Mock Service Worker, which intercepts network requests and provides realistic API responses. This approach allows for full-stack development without requiring a separate backend service during development and testing phases.

### Persistence Strategy

Data persistence is handled through a dual-layer approach combining localStorage for immediate access and IndexedDB for long-term storage. This strategy ensures data availability across browser sessions while providing fallback mechanisms for different storage scenarios.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Failures

If you encounter build failures, the most common cause is ESLint warnings being treated as errors in production environments. Check the console output for specific warning messages and address any unused variables, missing dependencies, or code quality issues. The application is configured to treat warnings as errors in CI environments to maintain code quality.

### Performance Issues

Large datasets may cause performance issues in the candidate pipeline view. The application includes virtualization for large lists, but if you experience slowdowns, consider implementing pagination or reducing the number of items displayed simultaneously. The drag and drop functionality is optimized for reasonable dataset sizes.

### Storage Limitations

Browser storage has limitations that may affect the application with very large datasets. localStorage typically supports 5-10MB of data, while IndexedDB can handle much larger amounts. If you encounter storage quota errors, consider implementing data cleanup routines or moving to a server-based storage solution.

### Browser Compatibility

The application requires modern browser features including ES6 support, CSS custom properties, and Service Worker capabilities. If you encounter compatibility issues, ensure you are using a recent version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Internet Explorer is not supported.

### Mock API Limitations

The Mock Service Worker approach has limitations when it comes to complex server-side operations. If you need advanced features like real-time updates, complex queries, or server-side processing, you may need to implement a proper backend API.

## Technical Decisions

### Framework Selection

React was chosen as the primary framework due to its mature ecosystem, excellent performance characteristics, and strong community support. The decision to use functional components with hooks aligns with modern React best practices and provides better performance than class-based components.

### State Management Approach

The decision to avoid external state management libraries like Redux was made to keep the application simple and maintainable. Local component state with props drilling provides sufficient functionality for this application scope while reducing complexity and bundle size.

### Styling Strategy

Pure CSS was chosen over CSS frameworks to maintain complete design control and minimize bundle size. This approach allows for custom theming, responsive design patterns, and performance optimizations that would be difficult to achieve with pre-built frameworks.

### API Mocking Solution

Mock Service Worker was selected over alternatives like JSON Server because it provides more realistic network behavior and works seamlessly in both development and testing environments. This approach eliminates the need for a separate server process during development.

### Persistence Implementation

The dual persistence strategy using localStorage and IndexedDB was implemented to balance performance and reliability. localStorage provides immediate access for frequently used data, while IndexedDB serves as a backup and handles larger datasets more efficiently.

### Build System Choice

Create React App was chosen to avoid configuration complexity while providing a modern build system with webpack, Babel, and other essential tools. This decision allows focus on application development rather than build configuration management.

### Testing Framework

React Testing Library was selected for its user-centric testing approach, which encourages writing tests that reflect how users actually interact with the application. This leads to more meaningful tests and better confidence in application behavior.

### Performance Optimization Strategy

Several performance optimization techniques were implemented including virtualized lists for large datasets, debounced search inputs to reduce API calls, and optimistic updates for better perceived performance. These decisions were made to ensure smooth user experience even with substantial amounts of data.

### Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility features were built into the application from the beginning, including proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility. These decisions ensure the application is usable by people with various abilities and meets modern web accessibility standards.

### Security Approach

Security considerations include input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks, safe HTML rendering practices, and careful handling of user-generated content. While the application uses local storage, no sensitive information is stored in browser storage, maintaining user privacy and security.
